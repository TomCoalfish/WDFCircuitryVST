# WDFCircuitryVST
Modelling simple analogue guitar effects circuitry using Wave Digital Filters (Will Pirkle Library)

Implementing and adding to Will Pirkle's WDF Library in the JUCE framework in C++. Currently setting up a High pass at 34Hz, a distortion unit (unused currently),
a Tone (bass) control with a high pass ranging from 100 - 8000Hz (too much atm), and a volume control based on a potentiomenter.

- GUI needs work
- Distortion needs processing
- Tone control for low pass filter??
